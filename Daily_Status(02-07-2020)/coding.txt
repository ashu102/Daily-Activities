1. Write a program that will read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user and will print the same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user will input a zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers will be entered.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int number;
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number you want to check:");
        number = scan.nextInt();
        scan.close();
        if(number > 0)
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is positive number");
        }
        else if(number < 0)
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is negative number");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println(number+" is neither positive nor negative");
        }
    }
}




2. Python Program to Create a Class in which One Method Accepts a String from the User and Another Prints its
class print1():
    def __init__(self):
        self.string=""
    def get(self):
        self.string=input("Enter string: ")
    def put(self):
        print("String is:")
        print(self.string)
obj=print1()
obj.get()
obj.put()
