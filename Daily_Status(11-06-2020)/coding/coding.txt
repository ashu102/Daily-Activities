def to_uppercase(str1):
    num_upper = 0
    for letter in str1[:4]: 
        if letter.upper() == letter:
            num_upper += 1
    if num_upper >= 2:
        return str1.upper()
    return str1

print(to_uppercase('Python'))
print(to_uppercase('PyThon'))

2.Python Program to find the average of all Items in a Dictionary Step1: Get the name as key and marks as value for n students Step2: find the average of the marks of all the students and print it




from statistics import mean

StudentGrades = {
    'Ivan': [4.32, 3, 2],
    'Martin': [3.45, 5, 6],
    'Stoyan': [2, 5.67, 4],
    'Vladimir': [5.63, 4.67, 6]
}

for st,vals in StudentGrades.items():
    print("Average for {} is {}".format(st,mean(vals)))
